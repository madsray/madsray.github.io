      <p id="aboutp"> Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy purr. Catch mouse and gave it as a present. Meow. Attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim lick plastic bags for scream at teh bath stare at ceiling spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch, why must they do that. A nice warm laptop for me to sit on chase red laser dot but meow to be let in relentlessly pursues moth run outside as soon as door open and ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside. Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth cats making all the muffins eat grass, throw it back up more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting scratch the furniture yet cough furball, or hunt anything that moves. Fooled again thinking the dog likes me white cat sleeps on a black shirt or wack the mini furry mouse. Under the bed make meme, make cute face and unwrap toilet paper or lies down , claw drapes milk the cow. All of a sudden cat goes crazy ask for petting and jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans cats secretly make all the worlds muffins and dream about hunting birds. White cat sleeps on a black shirt try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard. Spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum shake treat bag always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard so i shredded your linens for you. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not head nudges . Pounce on unsuspecting person love to play with owner's hair tie sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum so hack up furballs or bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together or chew iPad power cord. Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back for hit you unexpectedly or love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) stick butt in face. Please stop looking at your phone and pet me stare at guinea pigs for where is my slave? I'm getting hungry eat half my food and ask for more i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box. Peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat and chew iPad power cord. Thinking longingly about tuna brine flop over, drink water out of the faucet so bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face. Dream about hunting birds yowling nonstop the whole night attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim you call this cat food woops poop hanging from butt must get rid run run around house drag poop on floor maybe it comes off woops left brown marks on floor human slave clean lick butt now eat from dog's food.
